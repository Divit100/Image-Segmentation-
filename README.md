# Image-Segmentation-

In this project,I was able to segement a given image.The parts of image (bride,sky,ocean ) are segmented into different parts on the basis of instensity of flow of colour in them.
I attach the image here as the outputs of the image are displayed in seperate windows and not in the notebook itself.

At the left side ,we can see the original image where I select mutiple parts in the image and the segmentation of the image is shown in the window at the right side.
